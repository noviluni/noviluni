### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marc, a Software Developer from Mallorca, Spain. :sunny:

I'm currently working at [Belvo](https://belvo.com/) in the Data Extraction Squad and I'm the maintainer of the [dateparser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser) library. You will see that I also spend some time contributing to other Open Source projects as 
[Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pulls?q=author%3Anoviluni), [number-parser](https://github.com/arnavkapoor/number-parser/issues?q=author%3Anoviluni+), etc.

ðŸ“« If you want to contact me feel free to open an issue to my [personal repo](https://github.com/noviluni/noviluni) indicating what do you want and how to contact with you (without adding any sensitive data :smile:).
